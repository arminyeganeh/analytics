# Data Frames in R P.1

A data frame is the most common way of storing data in R and, generally, is the data structure most often used for data analyses. Under the hood, a data frame is a list of equal-length vectors . Each element of the list can be thought of as a column and the length of each element of the list is the number of rows. As a result, data frames can store different classes of objects in each column (i.e. numeric, character, factor). In essence, the easiest way to think of a data frame is as an Excel worksheet that contains columns of different types of data but are all of equal length rows. In this chapter I will illustrate how to create data frames , add additional elements to pre- existing data frames , add attributes to data frames , and subset data frames .

### Creating data frames&#x20;

Data frames are usually created by reading in a dataset using `read.table()` or `read.csv()`; this will be covered in the importing and scraping data chapters. However, data frames can also be created explicitly with the data.frame() function or they can be coerced from other types of objects like lists. In this case, Iâ€™ll create a simple data frame df and assess its basic structure:&#x20;

```r
df <- data.frame (col1 = 1:3, 
                  col2 = c ("this", "is", "text"), 
                  col3 = c (TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), 
                  col4 = c (2.5, 4.2, pi))
                  
# assess the structure of a data frame
str (df)

## 'data.frame': 3 obs. of 4 variables:
## $ col1: int 1 2 3
## $ col2: chr  "this" "is" "text"
## $ col3: logi TRUE FALSE TRUE
## $ col4: num 2.5 4.2 3.14

# number of rows
nrow (df)
## [1] 3

# number of columns
ncol (df)
## [1] 4
```

### Adding on to data frames&#x20;

We can leverage the function `cbind()` for adding columns to a data frame. Note that one of the objects being combined must already be a data frame otherwise `cbind()` could produce a matrix.

```r
df
##  col1 col2  col3     col4
##1    1 this  TRUE 2.500000
##2    2   is FALSE 4.200000
##3    3 text  TRUE 3.141593

cbind (df, v4)
##  col1 col2  col3     col4 v4
##1    1 this  TRUE 2.500000  A
##2    2   is FALSE 4.200000  B
##3    3 text  TRUE 3.141593  C
```

We can also use the function `rbind()` to add data frame rows together. However, severe caution should be taken because this can cause changes in the classes of the columns. For instance, our data frame df currently consists of an integer, character, logical, and numeric variables.

```r
adding_df <- data.frame (col1 = 4,
                         col2 = "R",
                         col3 = FALSE,
                         col4 = 1.1,
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

df3 <- rbind (df, adding_df)
df3
##   col1 col2  col3     col4
## 1    1 this  TRUE 2.500000
## 2    2   is FALSE 4.200000
## 3    3 text  TRUE 3.141593
## 4    4    R FALSE 1.100000

str (df3)
## 'data.frame':	4 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ col1: num  1 2 3 4
##  $ col2: chr  "this" "is" "text" "R"
##  $ col3: logi  TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE
##  $ col4: num  2.5 4.2 3.14 1.1
```

There are better ways to join data frames together than to use cbind() and rbind(). We will cover some of those later when transforming data with the **dplyr package**.

### Adding attributes to data frames

Similar to matrices, data frames will have a dimension attribute. In addition, data frames can also have additional attributes such as row names, column names, and comments. We can illustrate with data frame `df`.

```r
df
##   col1 col2  col3     col4
## 1    1 this  TRUE 2.500000
## 2    2   is FALSE 4.200000
## 3    3 text  TRUE 3.141593

dim(df)
## [1] 3 4

attributes(df)
## $names
## [1] "col1" "col2" "col3" "col4"
## $class
## [1] "data.frame"
## $row.names
## [1] 1 2 3
```

Currently, df does not have row names but we can add them with `rownames()` . We can also change the existing column names by using `colnames()` or `names()`. Lastly, just like vectors, lists, and matrices, we can add a comment to a data frame without affecting how it operates.

```r
# add row names
rownames (df) <- c ("row1", "row2", "row3")

# add/change column names with colnames()
colnames (df) <- c ("col_1", "col_2", "col_3", "col_4")

# adding a comment attribute
comment (df) <- "adding a comment to a data frame"

attributes(df)
## $names
## [1] "col_1" "col_2" "col_3" "col_4"
## $class
## [1] "data.frame"
## $row.names
## [1] "row1" "row2" "row3"
## $comment
## [1] "adding a comment to a data frame" 
```
