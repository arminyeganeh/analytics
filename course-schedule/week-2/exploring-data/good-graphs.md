# Central Tendency

"A histogram of a quantitative variable can inform us about the shape of the distribution, whether it has extreme values, or where its center is approximate. But visual displays don't produce the numbers that are often important to answering our questions. How far are hotels from the city center in general? What's the spread of prices? How skewed is the distribution of customer ratings? To answer such questions we need numerical summaries (statistics) of variables ... Most readers are probably well acquainted with many summary statistics, including the mean, the median (the middle value), various quantiles (terciles, quartiles, percentiles), and the mode (the value with the highest frequency in the data). The mean, median, and mode are also called **measures of central tendency** because they give an answer to where the center of the distribution is. Those answers may be the same (the mean, median, and mode may be equal, or very close to each other), or they may be different. Importantly, we use the terms mean, average, and expected value as synonyms." (Bekes, 2021)
