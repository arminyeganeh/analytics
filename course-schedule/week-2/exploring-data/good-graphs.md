# Central Tendency

"The mean is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations. The mean is often called the average." (Agresti, 2018)

"The median is the observation that falls in the middle of the ordered sample. When the sample size n is odd, a single observation occurs in the middle. When the sample size is even, two middle observations occur, and the median is the midpoint between the two." (Agresti, 2018)

"The mean, median, and mode are complementary measures. They describe different aspects of the data. In any particular example, some or all their values may be useful. Be on the lookout for misleading statistical analyses, such as using one statistic when another would be more informative. People who present statistical conclusions often choose the statistic giving the impression they wish to convey ... Be wary of the mean when the distribution may be highly skewed." (Agresti, 2018)

"A histogram of a quantitative variable can inform us about the shape of the distribution, whether it has extreme values, or where its center is approximate. But visual displays don't produce the numbers that are often important to answering our questions. How far are hotels from the city center in general? What's the spread of prices? How skewed is the distribution of customer ratings? To answer such questions we need numerical summaries (statistics) of variables ... Most readers are probably well acquainted with many summary statistics, including the mean, the median (the middle value), various quantiles (terciles, quartiles, percentiles), and the mode (the value with the highest frequency in the data). The mean, median, and mode are also called **measures of central tendency** because they give an answer to where the center of the distribution is. Those answers may be the same (the mean, median, and mode may be equal, or very close to each other), or they may be different. Importantly, we use the terms mean, average, and expected value as synonyms." (Bekes, 2021)
