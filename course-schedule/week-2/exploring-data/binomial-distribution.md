# Binomial Distribution

"The binomial distribution is based on the Bernoulli distribution. A variable has a binomial distribution if it is the sum of independent Bernoulli variables with the same p parameter. Some actual variables that may have a binomial distribution include the number of car accidents, the number of times our portfolio experiences a large loss, and the number of times an expert correctly predicts if a new movie will be profitable. Binomial variables have two parameters: p, the probability of one for each Bernoulli variable, and n, the number of Bernoulli variables that are added up. The possible values of a binomial variable are zero, one, and all other integer numbers up to n. Its range is therefore 0 through n. The histogram of a binomial variable has n+ 1 bars (zero, one, through n) if not grouped in bins. The binomial distribution has one mode in the middle, and it is symmetric so its median, mean, and mode are the same. With a large n, the histogram of a binomial variable is bell-shaped. The mean of a binomial variable is np, and its variance is np(l-p), so its standard deviation is the root of np(l-p)."
