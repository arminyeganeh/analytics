# Bernoulli Distribution

"Bernoulli distribution The distribution of a zero-one binary variable is called Bernoulli. The name comes from Jacob Bernoulli, the mathematician from the 1600s who first examined it. The Bernoulli distribution is one of those rare theoretical distributions that we observe over and over: all zero—one variables are distributed Bernoulli. (Note the use of words: if the distribution of a variable is Bernoulli, we say "it is distributed Bernoulli"; we'll use this expression for other theoretical distributions, too.) Examples include whether a customer makes a purchase, whether the CEO of a firm is young, whether a portfolio produces a large negative loss, or whether the online price of a product is lower than its offline price. The Bernoulli distribution has one parameter: p, the probability of observing value one (instead of value zero). With only two possible values, zero and one, the range of the Bernoulli distribution is zero to one, and its histogram consists of two bars: the frequency of observations with value zero, and the frequency of observations with value one. If, instead of frequency, the histogram shows the proportion of each value, the height of the bar at value one is equal to p, and the height of the bar at zero equals 1 — p. The mean of a Bernoulli variable is simply p, the proportion of ones. (To verify this try p 0 or 1 or p = 0.5.) Its variance is p(l — p) so its standard deviation is p(l — p)." (Bekes, 2021)
