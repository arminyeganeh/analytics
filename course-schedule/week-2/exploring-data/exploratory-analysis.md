# Exploratory Analysis

"There are five important reasons to do exploratory (i.e., descriptive) data analysis. First, to know if our data is clean and ready for analysis. An informative description of variables tells us about problems that we need to address in the data cleaning process. Results of exploratory analysis may show too few observations because we discarded too many by mistake; they may suggest that the true units of measurement are different from what we thought, or they may tell us that there are values that a variable should not have because of mistakes ... &#x20;

Second, to guide subsequent analysis. Some features of variables, such as how spread the values are or whether there are extreme values, have important consequences for further analysis. Exploratory data analysis may suggest that data analysts transform a variable, or what method may be best suited to analyze patterns related to a variable. The results of EDA may also help in getting a sense of what we can expect from future analysis ...

Third, to give context. Describing the most important variables in our data is an important part of presenting the results of data analysis. Decision makers who will use those results need to know what is contained in key variables and how their characteristics affect the interpretation of the main results ...&#x20;

Fourth, sometimes, we can answer our questions with very simple tools that are used as parts of exploratory data analysis. That's quite rare, but when that's the case, exploratory data analysis is the end of our analysis.&#x20;

Fifth, to ask more questions. Quite often, exploratory data analysis uncovers an interesting phenomenon for a variable of interest. This should lead to asking questions that further analysis with more data and more sophisticated methods may answer." (Bekes, 2021)
