# Box Plot

"The summary statistics we discussed are often presented in table format. But there are creative ways to combine some of them in graphs. We consider two such graphs. The more traditional visualization is the box plot, also called the box and whiskers plot. The box plot is really a one-dimensional vertical graph, only it is shown with some width so it looks better. The center of a box plot is a horizontal line at the median value of the variable, placed within a box. The upper side of the box is the third quartile (the 75th percentile) and the lower side is the first quartile (the 25th percentile). Vertical line segments on both the upper and lower side of the box capture most of the rest of the distribution. The ends of these line segments are usually drawn at 1.5 times the inter-quartile range added to the third quartile and subtracted from the first quartile. These endpoints are called adjacent values in the box plot. The lines between the lower (upper) adjacent value and the 25th (75th) percentile range are called whiskers. Observations with values not contained within those values are usually added to the box plot as dots with their respective values. The box plot conveys many important features of distributions such as their skewness and shows some of the quantiles in an explicit way." (Bekes, 2021)&#x20;
