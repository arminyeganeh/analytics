# Standardized Values

"The standard deviation is often used to re-calculate differences between values of a quantitative variable, in order to express those values relative to what a typical difference would be. In a formula, this amounts to dividing the difference by the standard deviation. Such measures are called standardized differences. A widely used standardized difference is from the mean value; it is called the standardized value of a variable or the z-score of the variable." (Bekes, 2021)
