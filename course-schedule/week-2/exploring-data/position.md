# Position

"Another way to describe a distribution is with a measure of position. This tells us the point at which a given percentage of the data fall below (or above) that point. As special cases, some measures of position describe center and some describe variabi lily. Quartiles and Other Percentiles The range uses two measures of position, the maximum value and the minimum value. The median is a measure of position, with half the data falling below it and half above it. The median is a special case of a set of measures of position called percentiles. Percentile

The pth percentile is the point such that p% of the observations fall below or at that point and (100 â€” p)% fall above it.

Lower and Upper Quartiles

The 25th percentile is called the lower quartile. The 75th percentile is called the upper quartile. One quarter of the data fall below the lower quartile. One quarter fall above the upper quartile. The quartiles result from p = 25 and p = 75 in the percentile definition. The lower quartile is the median for the observations that fall below the median. that is. for the bottom half of the data. The upper quartile is the median for the observations that fall above the median, that is, for the upper half of the data. The quartiles together with the median split the distribution into four parts, each containing one-fourth of the observations." (Agresti, 2018)
