# Variability

"The mean of a quantitative variable is the value that we can expect for a randomly chosen observation. The mean of a 0/1 binary variable is the proportion of observations with a value of 1. Similarly, most readers know the most important **measures of spread**, such as the range (the difference between the largest and smallest value), inter-quantile ranges (e.g., the 90â€”10 percentile range, or the inter-quartile range), the standard deviation, and the variance. The standard deviation captures the typical difference between a randomly chosen observation and the mean. The variance is the square of the standard deviation. The variance is a less intuitive measure, but it is easier to work with because it is a mean value itself. Note that alternative formulae for the variance and the standard deviation divide by (n - 1) not (n). Most data are large enough that this makes no practical difference. It turns out that dividing by (n - 1) is the correct formula if we use the statistic in the data to infer the standard deviation in the population that our data represents." (Bekes, 2021)
