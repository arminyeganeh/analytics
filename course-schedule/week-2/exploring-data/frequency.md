# Frequency

"The absolute frequency, or count, of a value of a variable is simply the number of observations with that particular value in the data. The relative frequency is the frequency expressed in relative, or percentage, terms: the proportion of observations with that particular value among all observations in the data. If a variable has missing values, this proportion can be relative to all observations including the missing values or only to observations with non-missing values. Most often we express proportions excluding observations with missing values. When our goal is to check the data cleaning process, absolute frequencies including missing values is the better option."
