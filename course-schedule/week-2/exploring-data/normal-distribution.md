# Normal Distribution

"Theoretical distributions are distributions of variables with idealized properties ... But why should we care about theoretical distributions? The main reason is that they can be of great help when we want to understand important characteristics of variables in our data. Theoretical distributions are usually simple to describe and have a few well-established properties. If a variable in our data is well approximated by a theoretical distribution, we can simply attribute those properties to the variable without having to check those properties over and over. It turns out that there are surprisingly many real-world variables whose distributions are quite well approximated by one of the theoretical distributions.&#x20;

The **normal distribution** is the best-known and most widely used theoretical distribution of quantitative variables. It is a purely theoretical construct in the sense that it was derived mathematically from another distribution, **the binomial**. Variables with a normal distribution can in principle take on any value from negative infinity to positive infinity. The histogram of the normal distribution is **bell-shaped**. For that reason, the popular name for the normal distribution is **the bell curve**. It is also called the **Gaussian distribution** after the German mathematician who played a role in popularizing it (it was the French mathematician Laplace who first derived it).&#x20;

A special case of the normal distribution is the **standard normal distribution**. It is a normal distribution with parameters 0 and 1: its mean is zero and its standard deviation is one (and thus its variance is also one). It turns out that when we transform a normally distributed variable by adding or multiplying by a number, the result is another normally distributed variable, with appropriately transformed mean and standard deviation. It also turns out that when we add two normally distributed variables, the resulting new variable is also normally distributed, and its mean is the sum of the means of the two original variables.&#x20;

Some variables in real life are well approximated by the normal distribution. The height of people in a population is usually approximately normal, and so is their IQ, a measure of intelligence (although that is in part because the tests behind the IQ measure are constructed that way). Variables in real life are well approximated by the normal distribution if they are a result of adding up many small things." (Bekes, 2021)&#x20;
