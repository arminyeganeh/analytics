# Empirical Rule

"If the histogram of the data is approximately bell shaped, then

1. About 68% of the observations fall between y — s and y + s.
2. About 95% of the observations fall between y — 2s and y + 2s.
3. All or nearly all observations fall between y — 3s and y + 3s.

The rule is called the Empirical Rule because many distributions seen in practice (that is, empirically) are approximately bell shaped." (Agresti, 2018)
