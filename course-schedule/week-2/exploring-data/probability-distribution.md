# Probability Distribution

"The normal distribution is symmetric, bell-shaped, and characterized by its mean and standard deviation. The probability within any particular number of standard deviations of the mean is the same for all normal distributions. This probability equals 0.68 within 1 standard deviation, 0.95 within 2 standard deviations, and 0.997 within 3 standard deviations." (Agresti, 2018)

"The Probability Distribution Function, or PDF, the pdf is the theoretical generalization of the histogram and its smoother cousin, the density plot. The pdf of qualitative (also called discrete) variables, including binary variables, shows the probability of each value in the distribution. The pdf of quantitative (continuous) variables, such as normal or lognormal variables, shows the probability of each value and the values in its close neighborhood in the distribution. The pdf is expressed in a formula as a function of the parameters of the distribution, and it is often represented graphically as a bar chart like the histogram (for qualitative variables) or as a continuous curve like a density plot (for continuous variables)." (Bekes, 2021)

"The probability distribution function is the integral of the probability density function".
