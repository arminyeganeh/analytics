# Conditioning

"The word statisticians use for comparison is conditioning. When we compare the values of y by the values of x, we condition y on x. y is also called the outcome variable; x is also called the conditioning variable. Most of the time, we will simply call them y and x. When data analysts want to uncover values of y for observations that are different in x but similar in z, they do one more step of conditioning: they compare y by x conditional on z. That is called further conditioning or a conditional comparison. Thus the word conditioning can be confusing if used without more context. It may mean a simple comparison — uncovering values of y for different values of x — or it may mean a conditional comparison — uncovering values of y for observations that are different in x but the same in z ... Conditioning is an abstract concept. In practice, we explore conditional probabilities, conditional means, and conditional distributions."
