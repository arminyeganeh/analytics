# Variation Sources

"Data analysts need to understand the sources of variation in x ... why values of x may differ across observations ... in observational data, no variable is fully controlled by an experimenter or any other person. Most data used in business, economics, and policy analysis are observational. Typical variables in such data are the results of the decisions of many people with diverging goals and circumstances, such as customers, managers of firms, administrators in a government, or members of the board of the monetary authority ... For example, the price of a product (x) sold by a retailer may vary across time. In a sense that variation has one source, the decisions of people in charge at the retail company. But that decision, in turn, is likely affected by many things, including costs, predicted customer demand, and the pricing decisions of competitors, all of which may change over time and thus lead to variation in prices. Here a data analyst may want to uncover what would happen if the retailer increased its price (x) on sales (y), using observational data. That requires conditioning on price: looking at differences in sales across observations with different prices ... The data analyst then may go on to try to further condition on those other things that are sources of variation, such as the price charged by the competitors, or seasonal variation in demand. If lucky, the data analyst may be able to measure all those variables. But that's a tall order in most cases ... The other frequent goal of data analysis, making predictions about y, poses somewhat different requirements for variation in x. Understanding the sources of variation in x or, more realistically, the many variables, is still useful, although not in the way it is in causal analysis. Here the main question is stability: whether the patterns of association between y and all those x variables are the same in our data as in the situation for which we make the prediction. Controlled variation in x helps only in the rare case when x would also be controlled in the situation we care about. But uncovering cause and effect relationships can be helpful in prediction in general" (Bekes, 2021)
