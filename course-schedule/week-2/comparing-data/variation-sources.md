# Variation Sources

"Data analysts need to understand the sources of variation in x. This is a somewhat fancy way of saying that data analysts should have a good understanding of why values of x may differ across observations. From this perspective, there are two main types of data: experimental data and observational data. Uncovering the effect of an experiment amounts to comparing y (such as whether a subject recovers from the illness or not) across the various values of x (whether a subject received the drug or not). In contrast, in observational data, no variable is fully controlled by an experimenter or any other person. Most data used in business, economics, and policy analysis are observational. Typical variables in such data are the results of the decisions of many people with diverging goals and circumstances, such as customers, managers of firms, administrators in a government, or members of the board of the monetary authority. Thus, typically, variation in these variables has multiple sources. Whether the variation in conditioning variables is controlled (experimental) or not (observational) is extremely important for causal analysis. Learning the effects of a variable x is a lot easier when we have data from an experiment, in which variation in x is controlled. With observational variation, of the many other things that affect an intervention variable, some may affect the outcome variable in a direct way, too. Disentangling those effects requires data analysts to further condition on many variables at the same time, using methods that we'll cover later in this textbook. Even with the best methods, conditioning on variables is possible only if those variables are measured in the data, which typically is not the case. We'll return to these questions in Chapter 10 and, in more detail, in Chapters 19 through 24. For example, the price of a product (x) sold by a retailer may vary across time. In a sense that variation has one source, the decisions of people in charge at the retail company. But that decision, in turn, is likely affected by many things, including costs, predicted customer demand, and the pricing decisions of competitors, all of which may change through time and thus lead to variation in prices. Here a data analyst may want to uncover what would happen if the retailer increased its price (x) on sales (y), using observational data. That requires conditioning on price: looking at differences in sales across observations with different prices. But the results of this comparison won't tell us what would happen if the retailer increased the price. That's because the question is about changing x as an autonomous decision, whereas, in the data, x tends to change together with some other things. The data analyst then may go on to try to further condition on those other things that are sources of variation, such as the price charged by the competitors, or seasonal variation in demand. If lucky, the data analyst may be able to measure all those variables. But that's a tall order in most cases. The power of experimental data is that there is no need to measure anything else. The other frequent goal of data analysis, making predictions about y, poses somewhat different requirements for variation in x. Understanding the sources of variation in x or, more realistically, the many variables, is still useful, although not in the way it is in causal analysis. Here the main question is stability: whether the patterns of association between y and all those x variables are the same in our data as in the situation for which we make the prediction. Controlled variation in x helps only in the rare case when x would also be controlled in the situation we care about. But uncovering cause and effect relationships can be helpful in prediction in general. We shall discuss these issues in more detail in Part Ill, from Chapter 13 through Chapter 18. This chapter introduced some fundamental concepts and methods of conditioning y on x, the statistical concept of comparing values of y by values of x (or more x variables). We'll return to conditioning yon x in Chapter 7 where we introduce regression analysis. Before doing so, we discuss some general principles and methods in the next chapter that help draw conclusions from our data about the situation we are really interested in. Main Takeaways Data analysis answers most questions by comparing values of y by values of x. Be explicit about what y and x are in your data and how they are related to the question of your analysis. E\[ylx] is mean y conditional on x. Data Exercises 115 Often many x variables are used for prediction and we may further condition on many other variables for causal analysis." (Bekes, 2021)
