# Dependence

Dependence of two variables, also called statistical dependence means that the conditional distributions of one variable (y) are not the same when conditional on different values of the other variable (x). In contrast, independence of variables means that the distribution of one conditional on the other is the same, regardless of the value of the conditioning variable. These concepts may be viewed as generalizations of independent events.&#x20;

Dependence takes many forms ... but the most important form of dependence is mean-dependence: the mean of y is different when the value of x is different. In other words, the conditional expectation E\[ylx] is not always the same but varies with the value of x. The covariance and the correlation coefficient are measures of this mean-dependence. To be a bit more precise, they measure mean dependence in an average sense. E\[ylx] may have ups and downs by the value of x, and the covariance and correlation coefficient are average measures of those ups and downs. When y and x are positively correlated, E\[ylx] tends to be higher when the value of x is higher. When y and x are negatively correlated, E\[ylx] tends to be lower when the value of x is higher. The two measures are very closely related: the correlation coefficient is the standardized version of the covariance.&#x20;

The formula for the covariance between two variables x and y in a dataset with n observations is:&#x20;
