# Variable scales

In terms of measurement scale, data analysts often distinguish four types of data: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These may be thought as refinements of the qualitative/quantitative classification.&#x20;

### Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio Scales of Measurement&#x20;

"For a quantitative variable, the possible numerical values are said to form an **interval scale**. Interval scales have a specific numerical distance or interval between each pair of levels. Annual income is usually measured on an interval scale. The interval between $40,000 and $30,000, for instance, equals $10,000. We can compare outcomes in terms of how much larger or how much smaller one is than the other. Categorical variables have two types of scales. For the categorical variables mentioned in the previous subsection, the categories are unordered. The scale does not have a "high" or "low" end. The categories are then said to form a nominal scale. For another example, a variable measuring primary mode of transportation to work might use the nominal scale with categories (automobile, bus, subway, bicycle, walk). Although the different categories are often called the levels of the scale, for a nominal variable no level is greater than or smaller than any other level. Names or labels such as "automobile" and "bus" for mode of transportation identify the categories but do not represent different magnitudes. By contrast, each possible value of a quantitative variable is greater than or less than any other possible value. A third type of scale falls, in a sense, between nominal and interval. It consists of categorical scales having a natural ordering of values. The levels form an **ordinal scale**. Examples are social class (upper, middle, lower), political philosophy (very liberal, slightly liberal, moderate, slightly conservative, very conservative).
