# Variable Classes 2

### Discrete and Continuous Variables&#x20;

"One other way to classify a variable also helps determine which statistical methods are appropriate for it. This classification refers to the number of values in the measurement scale. A variable is discrete if its possible values form a set of separate numbers, such as 0, 1, 2, ... It is continuous if it can take an infinite continuum of possible real number values." (Agresti, 2018)

### Stock and Flow Variables&#x20;

"In business, economics, and policy analysis we often work with quantities that could measure a flow or capture a stock. Flow variables are results of processes during some time ... The textbook example of a flow variable is the amount of water in a river that flowed through a reservoir gate yesterday; economic examples include sales of chocolate last month and the government deficit last year. Stock variables refer to quantities at a given point in time. Often, they are a snapshot of a business, a market, an economy, or a society. The textbook example is the amount of water in a reservoir at 8 a.m. this morning. Economic examples include the inventory of chocolate in a shop at the end of last month or the amount of government debt at the end of last year.&#x20;

The importance of distinguishing flow and stock variables comes from how we typically work with them. For example, their meaningful aggregation differs: often, flow variables are summed (monthly sales to annual sales); stock variables are averaged (average inventory at the end of each month last year)."
