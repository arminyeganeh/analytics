# Variables 3

### Discrete and Continuous Variables&#x20;

"One other way to classify a variable also helps determine which statistical methods are appropriate for it. This classification refers to the number of values in the measurement scale. A variable is discrete if its possible values form a set of separate numbers, such as 0, 1, 2, ... It is continuous if it can take an infinite continuum of possible real number values." (Agresti, 2018)
