### Variables

"Any characteristic we can measure for each subject is called a variable. The name reflects that values of the characteristic vary among subjects ... Different subjects may have different values of a variable. Examples of variables are income last year, number of siblings, whether employed, and gender. The values the variable can take form the measurement scale. The valid statistical methods for a variable depend on its measurement scale. We treat a numerical-valued variable such as annual income differently than a variable with a measurement scale consisting of categories, such as (yes, no) for whether employed." (Agresti, 2018)

### Quantitative and Categorical Variables

"A variable is called **quantitative** when the measurement scale has **numerical** values. The values represent different magnitudes of the variable. Examples of quantitative variables are a subject's annual income, number of siblings, age, and number of years of education completed. A variable is called **categorical** when the measurement scale is a set of **categories**. For example, marital status, with categories (single, married, divorced, widowed), is categorical. For Canadians, the province of residence is categorical, with the categories Alberta, British Columbia, and so on. Other categorical variables are whether employed (yes, no), primary clothes shopping destination (local mall, local downtown, Internet, other), favorite type of music (classical, country, folk, jazz, rock), religious affiliation (Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, other, none), and political party preference. For categorical variables, distinct categories differ in quality, not in numerical magnitude. Categorical variables are often called **qualitative**." (Agresti, 2018)&#x20;

"We distinguish between categorical and quantitative variables because different statistical methods apply to each type ... For example, the average is a statistical summary for a quantitative variable, because it uses numerical values. It's possible to find the average for a quantitative variable such as income, but not for a categorical variable such as religious affiliation or favorite type of music." (Agresti, 2018)

"**Binary variables** are a special case of qualitative variable: they can take on two values. Most often the information represented by binary variables is a yes/no answer to whether the observation belongs to some group. Examples include whether the respondent to a survey is female or not, whether a firm is in the manufacturing sector or not. For the purpose of data analysis, it is best to have them take values 0 or 1, 0 for no, and 1 for yes. Binary variables with 0/1 values are also called **dummy variables** or indicator variables.
