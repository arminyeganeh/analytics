# Random Sampling

"Inferential statistical methods use sample statistics to make predictions about population parameters. The quality of the inferences depends on how well the sample represents the population ... Simple random sampling is a method of sampling for which every possible sample has equal chance of selection. Let n denote the number of subjects in the sample, called the sample size. A simple random sample of n subjects from a population is one in which each possible sample of that size has the same probability (chance) of being selected ... Why is it a good idea to use random sampling? Because everyone has the same chance of inclusion in the sample, so it provides fairness. This reduces the chance that the sample is seriously biased in some way, leading to inaccurate inferences about the population. Most inferential statistical methods assume randomization of the sort provided by random sampling ... The most common method for selecting a random sample is to (1) number the subjects in the sampling frame, (2) generate a set of these numbers randomly, and (3) sample the subjects whose numbers were generated." (Agresti, 2018)

"Random sampling is the process that most likely leads to representative samples ... In practice, most random samples are selected with the help of random numbers generated by computers ... Other methods of random sampling include fixed rules that are unrelated to the distribution of variables in the data. Good examples are selecting people with odd-numbered birth dates (a 50% sample), or people with birthdays on the 15th of every month (approx. 3% sample). Again, these rules may not be viewed as "truly random" in a stricter sense, but that's not a concern for representation as long as the rules are not related to the variables used in the analysis. In contrast, non-random sampling methods may lead to selection bias. Non-random sampling methods are related to important variables. In other words, they have a higher or lower likelihood of selecting observations that are different in some important variables. As a result, the selected observations tend to be systematically different from the population they are drawn from. Consider two examples of non-random sampling methods. Selecting people from the first half of an alphabetic order is likely to lead to selection bias because people with different names may belong to different groups of society. Selecting the most recently established 10% of firms is surely not random for many reasons. One reason is called survivor bias: newly established firms include those that would fail within a short time after their establishment while such firms are not present among older firms ... Random sampling works very well if the sample is large enough. In small samples, it is possible that by chance, we pick observations that are not representative of the population. Consider for instance whether samples represent the age distribution of the population of a city. By picking a sample of two people, the share of young and older people may very well be different from their shares in the entire population. Thus, there is a considerable chance that this sample ends up being not representative even though it's a random sample. However, in a random sample of a thousand people, the share of young and old people is likely to be very similar to their shares in the population, leading to a representative sample.
