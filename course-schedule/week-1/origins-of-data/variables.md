# Variables

"Any characteristic we can measure for each subject is called a variable. The name reflects that values of the characteristic vary among subjects ... Different subjects may have different values of a variable. Examples of variables are income last year, number of siblings, whether employed, and gender. The values the variable can take form the measurement scale. The valid statistical methods for a variable depend on its measurement scale. We treat a numerical-valued variable such as annual income differently than a variable with a measurement scale consisting of categories, such as (yes, no) for whether employed." (Agresti, 2018)
