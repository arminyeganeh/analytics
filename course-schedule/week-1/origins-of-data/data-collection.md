# Data Collection

"Data can be collected for the purpose of the analysis, or it can be derived from information collected for other purposes. The structure and content of data purposely collected for the analysis are usually better suited to analysis. Such data is more likely to include variables that are the focus of the analysis, measured in a way that best suits the analysis, and structured in a way that is convenient for the analysis. Frequent methods to collect data include scraping the Web for information (web scraping) or conducting a survey. Data collected for other purposes (secondary data) can be also very useful to answer our inquiries. Data collected for the purpose of administering, monitoring, or controlling processes in business, public administration, or other environments are called administrative (admin) data. Admin data usually cover a complete population: all employees in a firm, all customers of a bank, or all tax filers in a country ... Often, data collected for other purposes is available at a low cost for many observations. At the same time, the structure and content of such data are usually further away from the needs of the analysis compared to purposely collected data. This trade-off has consequences that vary across data, methods, and questions to be answered." (Bekes, 2021)&#x20;

### Collecting Data with an Experiment

"In some studies, data result from a planned experiment. The purpose of most experiments is to compare responses of subjects on some outcome measure, under different conditions." (Agresti, 2018)

### Collecting Data with an Observational Study

"In social research, it is rarely possible to conduct experiments. It's not possible to randomly assign subjects to the groups we want to compare, such as levels of gender or race or educational level or annual income. Many studies merely observe the outcomes for available subjects on the variables without any experimental manipulation of the subjects. Such studies are called observational studies. The researcher measures subjects' responses on the variables of interest but has no experimental control over the subjects." (Agresti, 2018)
