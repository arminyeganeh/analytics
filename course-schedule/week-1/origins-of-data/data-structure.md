# Data Structure

"Observations in **cross-sectional data**, often abbreviated as xsec data, come from the same time, and they refer to different units such as different individuals, families, firms, and countries. Ideally, all observations in a cross-sectional dataset are observed at the exact same time. In practice, this often means a particular time interval. When that interval is narrow, data analysts treat it as if it were a single point in time.

In most cross-sectional data, the ordering of observations in the dataset does not matter: the first data row may be switched with the second data row, and the information content of the data would be the same. Cross-sectional data has the simplest structure. Therefore we introduce most methods and tools of data analysis using cross-sectional data and turn to other data structures later.

Observations in **time series data** refer to a single unit observed multiple times, such as a shop's monthly sales values. In time series data, there is a natural ordering of the observations, which is typically important for the analysis. A common abbreviation used for time series data is tseries data. We shall discuss the specific features of time series data in Chapter 1 2, where we introduce time series analysis.

**Multi-dimensional data**, as its name suggests, has more than one dimension. It is also called panel data. A common type of panel data has many units, each observed multiple times. Such data is called longitudinal data, or cross-section time series data, abbreviated as Xt data. Examples include countries observed repeatedly for several years, data on employees of a firm on a monthly basis, or prices of several company stocks observed on many days." (Bekes, 2021)&#x20;
