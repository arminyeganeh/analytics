# Types of Analysis

"Description and inference are the two types of statistical analysisâ€”ways of analyzing the data. Descriptive statistics summarize the information in a collection of data. Descriptive statistics consists of graphs, tables, and numbers such as averages and percentages. The main purpose of descriptive statistics is to reduce the data to simpler and more understandable forms without distorting or losing much information. Although data are usually available only for a sample, descriptive statistics are also useful when data are available for the entire population, such as in a census. By contrast, inferential statistics apply when data are available only for a sample but we want to make a prediction about the entire population. Inferential statistics provide predictions about a population, based on data from a sample of that population." (Agresti, 2018)
