# Data analytics

"Increasingly many jobs expect knowledge of statistical methods. Every day you are exposed to an explosion of information, from advertising, news reporting, political campaigning, surveys about opinions on controversial issues, and other communications containing statistical arguments. Statistics helps you make sense of this information and better understand the world. You will find concepts from this text helpful in judging the information you will encounter in your everyday life." (Agresti, 2018)

"Data analysis is a process. It starts with formulating a question and collecting appropriate data or assessing whether the available data can help answer the question. Then comes cleaning and organizing the data, tedious but essential tasks that affect the analysis results as much as any other step in the process. Exploratory data analysis gives context to the eventual results and helps us decide on the details of the analytical method to be applied. The main analysis consists of choosing and implementing the method to answer the question, with potential robustness checks. Along the way, correct interpretation and effective presentation of the results are crucial. Carefully crafted data visualization help summarize our findings and convey key messages. The final task is to answer the original question, with potential qualifications and directions for future inquiries." (Bekes, 2021)
