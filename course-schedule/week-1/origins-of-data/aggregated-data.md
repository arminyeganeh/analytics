# Aggregated Data

"Another important feature of data is the level of aggregation of observations. Data with information on people may have observations at different levels: age is at the individual level, home location is at the family level, and real estate prices may be available as averages for zip code areas. Sometimes data is available at a level of aggregation that is different from the ideal level. If data is too disaggregated (i.e., by establishments within firms when decisions are made at the firm level), we may want to aggregate all variables to the preferred level. If, however, the data is too aggregated (i.e., industry-level data when we want firm-level data), there isn't much that can be done. Such data miss potentially important information. Analyzing such data may uncover interesting patterns, but the discrepancy between the ideal level of aggregation and the available level of aggregation may have important consequences for the results and has to be kept in mind throughout the analysis."
