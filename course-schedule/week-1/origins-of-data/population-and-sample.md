# Population and Sample

"The entities that a study observes are called the subjects for the study. Usually, the subjects are people, such as in the GSS, but they might instead be families, schools, cities, or companies, for instance ... The **population** is the total set of subjects of interest in a study. A **sample** is the subset of the population on which the study collects data ... The ultimate goal of any study is to learn about populations. But it is almost always necessary, and more practical, to observe only samples from those populations. For example, the GSS and polling organizations such as the Gallup poll usually select samples of about 1000â€”3000 Americans to collect information about opinions and beliefs of the population of all Americans."
