# CSV Format

"A common file format for data tables is the csv file (for "comma separated values"). csv files are text files of a data table, with rows and columns. Rows are separated by end of line signs; columns are separated by a character called a delimiter (often a comma or a semicolon). Variables are identified by names. The data table may have variable names already, and analysts are free to use those names or rename the variables. Personal taste plays a role here: some prefer short names that are easier to work with in code; others prefer long names that are more informative; yet others prefer variable names that refer to something other than their content (such as the question number in a survey questionnaire). It is good practice to include the names of the variables in the first row of a csv data table. The observations start with the second row and go on until the end of the file. Observations are identified by identifier or ID variables. An observation is identified by a single ID variable, or by a combination of multiple ID variables. ID variables, or their combinations, should uniquely identify each observation. They may be numeric or text containing letters or other characters. They are usually contained in the first column of data tables." (Bekes, 2021)&#x20;
