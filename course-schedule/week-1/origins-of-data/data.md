# Data

"Data is "factual information, such as measurements or statistics, used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or calculation." (Merriam-Webster)&#x20;

"Information gathering is at the heart of all sciences, providing the observations used in statistical analyses. The observations gathered on the characteristics of interest are collectively called data." (Agresti, 2018)&#x20;

"Data rarely comes in a form that can directly answer our questions." (Bekes, 2021)

"Data is most straightforward to analyze if it forms a single data table. A data table consists of observations and variables. Observations are also known as cases. Variables are also called features. When using the mathematical name for tables, the data table is called the data matrix. A dataset is a broader concept that includes, potentially, multiple data tables with different kinds of information to be used in the same analysis. In a data table, the rows are the observations: each row is a different observation, and whatever is in a row is information about that specific observation. Columns are variables, so that column one is variable one, column two is another variable, and so on." (Bekes, 2021)&#x20;
