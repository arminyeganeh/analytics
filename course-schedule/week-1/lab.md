# Intro to R & RStudio

### Installing R

R is freely distributed online, and can be downloaded from:

> [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)

At the top of the page – under the heading “Download and Install R” – there are separate links for Windows, Mac, and Linux users. About every six months, a new update becomes available.&#x20;

#### Installing R on a Windows computer

On the R homepage, you’ll find a link at the top of the page with the text “Download R for Windows”. If you click on that, it will take you to a page that offers you a few options. Again, at the top of the page, you’ll be told to click on a link that says **Install R for the first time**. This will take you to a page that has a prominent link at the top called **Download R for Windows**. Click on that and your browser should start downloading an R installer file. After R is installed on your system, you should install RStudio.

#### Installing R on a Mac computer

On the R homepage, you’ll find a link at the top of the page with the text “Download R for macOS”. If you click on that, it will take you to a page that offers you a few options. There’s a fairly prominent link on the page just under Latest Release, with a “.pkg” format. Click on that link and you’ll start downloading the installer file. Once downloaded, open the file by double-clicking and follow all the instructions. Once finished, you’ll find a file called `R.app` in the Applications folder.  After R is installed on your system, you should install RStudio.

#### Installing RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), providing a free, open-source, professional interface to R, the underlying statistical language. RStudio can be downloaded from:

> [http://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

When you visit the RStudio website, find and download **RStudio Desktop**. After choosing the desktop version it will take you to a page that shows several possible downloads based on the operating system. The webpage automatically recommends the download that is most appropriate for your computer. Click on the appropriate link, and the RStudio installer file will start downloading. Once finished downloading, open the installer file in the usual way to install RStudio.&#x20;

### Opening R

After installing, you can start R by opening RStudio. To illustrate what RStudio looks like, Figure [3.1](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/introR.html#fig:RStudio) shows a screenshot of an R session in progress. In this screenshot, you can see that it’s running on a Mac, but it looks almost identical no matter what operating system you have. The Windows version looks more like a Windows application (e.g., the menus are attached to the application window and the colour scheme is slightly different), but it’s more or less identical. There are a few minor differences in where things are located in the menus (I’ll point them out as we go along) and in the shortcut keys, because RStudio is trying to “feel” like a proper Mac application or a proper Windows application, and this means that it has to change its behaviour a little bit depending on what computer it’s running on. Even so, these differences are very small: I started out using the Mac version of RStudio and then started using the Windows version as well in order to write these notes.
