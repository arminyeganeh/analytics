# Lab: Intro to R & RStudio

### Installing R

R is freely distributed online, and you can download it from the R homepage:

> [http://cran.r-project.org/](http://cran.r-project.org/)

At the top of the page – under the heading “Download and Install R” – you’ll see separate links for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. About every six months, a new update becomes available.&#x20;

#### Installing R on a Windows computer

On the CRAN homepage, you’ll find a link at the top of the page with the text “Download R for Windows”. If you click on that, it will take you to a page that offers you a few options. Again, at the top of the page, you’ll be told to click on a link that says **Install R for the first time**. This will take you to a page that has a prominent link at the top called **Download R for Windows**. Click on that and your browser should start downloading an R execution file. After R is installed on your system, you should install RStudio.
