# Student Survey 1

Welcome to Data Analytics and Emerging Technologies in Real Estate! I am conducting this introductory survey to understand students' backgrounds, interests, hopes, and expectations for the class. This is also an opportunity for you to tell us anything else I should know (e.g., the need for accommodations).

1. What is your preferred name?
2. What are your undergraduate major/program and minor (if applicable)?
3. Do you have any other graduate education? If so, what is it?
4. What has been your favorite course (either at MSU or elsewhere), and why?
5. What has been your least favorite course (either at MSU or elsewhere), and why?
6. How much of your life have you spent living in an urban environment? The United States Census Bureau defines "urban" as an area having an urban core of at least 50,000 people.
7. How much of your life have you spent living in a rural environment?
8. Based on what you know already, what are the topics you are most interested in (and in approximately what order)?
9. Based on what you know already, what are the topics you are least interested in?
10. Can I share your name and contact details with other students to organize group activities?
11. Is there anything else I should know (e.g., concerns, need for accommodations)?
