# Syllabus

## Part 1: Introduction <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Course Description <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

The term [_Analysis_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analysis) refers to a detailed examination of anything complex in order to understand its nature or to determine its essential features. [_Analytics_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytics) is the method of logical analysis, often using a model and performed by a computer. _Data Analytics_ is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions. Data analytics help businesses and individuals optimize their performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions. This graduate-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer questions, characterize trends, and identify opportunities for growth. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in business, finance, policy, and their personal life. Using widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will practice various approaches to data analytics, including looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics). Learners will acquire these skills through solving problems focused on housing and community development.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:&#x20;

* Use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts,&#x20;
* Import, export, and manipulate data,
* Create statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data,&#x20;
* Produce basic and advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run simple regression models,
* Produce statistical analysis reports in R Markdown/R Notebooks.

### Instructor Background and Contact <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

**Instructor Background:** Armin Yeganeh, Ph.D. is a tenure system Assistant Professor in the Construction Management Program at the School of Planning, Design, and Construction at Michigan State University (MSU). His research questions innovative practices and policies that can help advance construction management, sustainable housing, and real estate development. Armin is interested in employing empirical, quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of economic development, environmental protection, and societal equity to implement sustainability as part of planning, design, construction, and operations. Before joining MSU, Armin was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Virginia Tech where he earned his Ph.D. in Environmental Design and Planning. During his graduate education, he worked at the Virginia Center for Housing Research on drafting and presenting industry reports, studies, policies, programs, panel discussions, and presentations on housing and community development. Armin received his first master’s degree in Architectural Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. At Virginia Tech, he received a master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning and a master’s degree in Building Science and Construction Management.

**Contact preferences:** The best way to contact the instructor is to reach out by email (armin@msu.edu). Student-instructor communications respect [MSU’s policies on FERPA compliance](https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/privacyguidelines.aspx) and the maintenance of student data confidentiality. Office hours are by appointment. Students are encouraged to make use of office hours to discuss assignments and concepts. Use of office hours counts toward participation grades.

### Course Work

The statistical computing package we will use in this course is R, a data programming language used for statistics, data analysis, text analysis, and machine learning. R arguably is the fastest-growing and leading statistical tool for researchers. R is freely distributed online and can be downloaded from the R homepage [http://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). Students will use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), along with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) Desktop, to complete the assignments.

### Grading System

Final grades for this course are reported based on a numerical system that consists of the following scale: 4.0 - 3.5 - 3.0 - 2.5 - 2.0 - 1.5 - 1.0 - 0.0. While the final grades are in increments of 0.5, the Instructor may choose to give an intermediate grade on an assignment, e.g., a 3.3 on the midterm, but round up or down to the nearest reportable grade for the final course grade. All grades are final and may not be changed by re-examination or by the submission of additional work. In this class, the maximum grade is 4.0, which equals 400 points. The final grade equals the sum of points obtained for attendance (45 points), quiz (45 points), lab (90 points), and assignment (220 points). The course includes 45 sessions (each having 1 attendance point), 15 quizzes (each having 3 quiz points), 15 labs (each having 6 lab points), and 5 assignments (each having 40 assignment points).  &#x20;
