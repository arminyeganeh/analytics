# Syllabus

## Part 1: Introduction <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Course Description <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

The dictionary definition of [_Analysis_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analysis) is a detailed examination of anything complex in order to understand its nature or to determine its essential features. [_Analytics_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytics) is the method of logical analysis, often using a model and performed by a computer. _Data analytics_ is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions. Data analytics help businesses and individuals optimize their performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions. This graduate-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer questions, characterize trends, and identify opportunities for growth. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in business, finance, policy, and their personal life. Using widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will practice various approaches to data analytics, including looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics). Learners will acquire these skills through solving problems focused on housing and community development.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:&#x20;

* Use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts,&#x20;
* Import, export, and manipulate data,
* Create statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data,&#x20;
* Produce basic and advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run simple regression models,
* Produce statistical analysis reports in R Markdown/R Notebooks.

### Instructor Background and Contact <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

**Instructor Background:** Armin Yeganeh, Ph.D. is a tenure system Assistant Professor in the Construction Management Program at the School of Planning, Design, and Construction at Michigan State University. His research questions on innovative practices and policies that can help advance construction management, sustainable housing, and real estate development. Armin is interested in employing empirical, quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of economic development, environmental protection, and societal equity to implement sustainability as part of planning, design, construction, and operations. Before joining Michigan State University, Armin was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Virginia Tech where he earned his Ph.D. in Environmental Design and Planning. During his graduate education, he worked at the Virginia Center for Housing Research on drafting and presenting industry reports, studies, policies, programs, panel discussions, and presentations on housing and community development. Armin received his first master’s degree in Architectural Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. At Virginia Tech, he received a master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning and a master’s degree in Building Science and Construction Management.

**Contact preferences:** The best way to contact the instructor is to reach out by email (armin@msu.edu). Student-instructor communications respect [MSU’s policies on FERPA compliance](https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/privacyguidelines.aspx) and the maintenance of student data confidentiality. Office hours are by appointment. Students are encouraged to make use of office hours to discuss assignments and concepts. Use of office hours counts toward participation grades.

### Course Prerequisites <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

The only prerequisite for this class is graduate standing at Michigan State University. The class is quantitatively inclined, but university-level math is not required. Students may want to review the following topics if they have not used them recently: Microsoft Excel, Basic algebra (e.g., solving simultaneous equations), Basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation), Cartesian graphing (i.e., plotting functions on x- and y- axes), Logarithms (concepts and rules of), Scientific notation and significant figures, and Unit conversions in one to three dimensions.

### Textbooks

* [Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Business-Economics-Policy/dp/1108483011) by G. Bekez and G. Kezdi
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by G. Grolemund and H. Wickham

### Course Work

The statistical computing package we will use in this course is R, which is available on many campus computers. A copy from [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org/). We require that you use R Markdown to complete your assignments, which is enabled very nicely with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).
