# Syllabus

## Part 1: Introduction <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Course Description <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

The term [_Analysis_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analysis) refers to a detailed examination of anything complex in order to understand its nature or to determine its essential features. [_Analytics_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytics) is the method of logical analysis, often using a model and performed by a computer. _Data Analytics_ is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions. Data analytics help businesses and individuals optimize their performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions. This graduate-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer questions, characterize trends, and identify opportunities for growth. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in business, finance, policy, and their personal life. Using widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will practice various approaches to data analytics, including looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics). Learners will acquire these skills through solving problems focused on housing and community development.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:&#x20;

* Use R, read R documentation, and write R scripts,&#x20;
* Import, export, and manipulate data, and create statistical summaries,&#x20;
* Produce, interpret, and communicate basic and advanced statistical results,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run intermediate regression models,
* Apply non-linear statistical methods to address questions ill-suited for OLS regression,
* Draw inferences using statistical theory and report in R Markdown/R Notebooks,&#x20;

### Instructor <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

**Instructor's background:** Armin Yeganeh, Ph.D. is a tenure system Assistant Professor in the Construction Management Program at the School of Planning, Design, and Construction at Michigan State University (MSU). His research questions innovative practices and policies that can help advance construction management, sustainable housing, and real estate development. Armin is interested in employing empirical, quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of economic development, environmental protection, and societal equity to implement sustainability as part of planning, design, construction, and operations. Before joining MSU, Armin was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Virginia Tech where he earned his Ph.D. in Environmental Design and Planning. During his graduate education, he worked at the Virginia Center for Housing Research on drafting and presenting industry reports, studies, policies, programs, panel discussions, and presentations on housing and community development. Armin received his first master’s degree in Architectural Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. At Virginia Tech, he received a master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning and a master’s degree in Building Science and Construction Management.

**Instructor's teaching philosophy:** The instructor's teaching philosophy is based on the following four pillars: 1) Develop disciplinary competence through inquiry-based learning, experiential learning (e.g., PBL), research-based learning, and guided discovery learning; 2) Develop interdisciplinary competence emphasizing collaborations and partnerships between programs by working with and learning from learners from other disciplines; 3) Develop intrapersonal competence emphasizing self-directed life-long learning, innovation, critical thinking, ethics, and conscientiousness; 4) Develop interpersonal competence emphasizing communication, teamwork, leadership, project management, and social and intercultural activities.

**Instructor contact preferences:** The best way to contact the instructor is to reach out by email (armin@msu.edu). Student-instructor communications respect [MSU’s policies on FERPA compliance](https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/privacyguidelines.aspx) and the maintenance of student data confidentiality. Office hours are by appointment. Students are encouraged to make use of office hours to discuss assignments and concepts. Use of office hours counts toward participation grades.

## Part 3: Assessment <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

Students are assessed on the following components: participation, weekly quizzes, completion of problem-based assignments, and an inquiry-based class presentation. Students are expected to complete core readings for every module and complementary readings for at least one module based on interest. Students will report which module for which they would like to complete the complementary readings by way of a poll. Class presentations will revolve around complementary readings and will be led by students who completed the associated readings. Every week and at the end of the second lecture, there is a short quiz on the assigned core reading.&#x20;

Weekly assignment submissions take the form of a single [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), composed of three sets of lab questions and three sets of homework questions. Except where otherwise noted, assignments are due at the end of the corresponding module, on Fridays at 11:59 pm ET. Assignments will be evaluated on the basis of correctness and style. Complete descriptions and instructions for completing assessments will be provided when assignments are published on the course website. All submissions are individual except where group work is expressly permitted. Adherence to the Honor Code (see below) will be rigorously enforced.

### Grading System

Final grades for this course are reported based on a numerical system that consists of the following scale: 4.0 - 3.5 - 3.0 - 2.5 - 2.0 - 1.5 - 1.0 - 0.0. While the final grades are in increments of 0.5, the Instructor may choose to give an intermediate grade on an assignment, e.g., a 3.3 on the midterm, but round up or down to the nearest reportable grade for the final course grade. All grades are final and may not be changed by re-examination or by the submission of additional work. In this class, the maximum grade is 4.0, which equals 400 points. The final grade equals the sum of points obtained for attendance (45 points), quiz (45 points), lab (90 points), and assignment (220 points). The course includes 45 sessions (each having 1 attendance point), 15 quizzes (each having 3 quiz points), 15 labs (each having 6 lab points), and 5 assignments (each having 40 assignment points). Presentations will have 15 bonus points.  &#x20;

This is a three-credit class that can be taken for an ordinal grade or pass/fail depending on the individual program requirements. The instructor does not have control over the grading option by which learners are evaluated. To change your grading option, learners should contact the registrar’s office and/or the program coordinator. The minimum cumulative grade-point average required for graduation is 3.0 for graduate students.

## Part 4: Policies <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Time Commitment ****&#x20;

This is a 3-credit hour course, which means students should anticipate spending at least 2 hours 30 min a week on class materials, which may include attending lectures or participating in group discussions or lab activities. Additionally, students should anticipate another two hours of reading/homework/study time per lecture hour. Therefore, students are expected to spend an additional six hours a week reading, working on assigned homework, and studying for exams.

### **Participation Expectations**

Students who actively participate in class, e.g., by some combination of asking and responding to questions, posting relevant material to the discussion board, and attending office hours get full marks for participation. No one type of engagement is required per se, but students will be evaluated on their engagement with the class holistically. In class, cell phones must be silenced (not vibrate). Laptop computers must be turned off during lectures, as they are distracting to other students or the instructor.&#x20;

### **Late Assignments**

Submission of assignments past the posted due date is subject to penalty at the instructor's discretion. If there are circumstances that require late submission of an assignment, students should contact the instructor as far in advance as possible to discuss a contingency plan. Depending on the circumstances, accommodations may include penalty-free late submission or waiver of the assignment. Students should be prepared to submit evidence of the circumstances that necessitate an accommodation.

### Communication&#x20;

* Assignments and class information will be posted on the class website.
* For other matters, please email the instructor, including code 94842 in the subject line.

The Piazza forum should be used for general course-related questions that may be of interest to others in the class.&#x20;

### Classroom Accessibility&#x20;

If a student needs adaptations or accommodations because of a disability (learning disability, attention deficit disorder, psychological, physical, etc.), or if there is emergency medical information to share, students can contact the instructor via email or make an appointment to discuss. Any student with a disability that may need accommodations in order to successfully complete all requirements of this course should visit the Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities ([www.rcpd.msu.edu](https://www.rcpd.msu.edu/)), located in Bessey Hall, 434 Farm Lane, #120, East Lansing, MI 48824-1033 or by email at rcpd@msu.edu.
