# Syllabus

## Part 1: Introduction <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Course Description <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

_Data Analytics_ comprises the application of raw data, tools, and processes to inform decision-making. Data analytics helps businesses and individuals optimize their performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions. This three-credit hour graduate-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer questions, characterize trends, and identify opportunities for growth. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in real estate business, finance, policy, and even in personal life. Using widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will study various approaches to data analytics, including looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics). Throughout problem-based learning activities, learners apply the data analytics knowledge acquired from lectures and readings by developing case studies focused on housing and community development.

### Course Objectives

This course covers the application of quantitative techniques to real estate:&#x20;

* Fundamentals of applied quantitative methods&#x20;
* Fundamentals of data programming for statistical analysis
* Data collection from major socioeconomic and real estate data sources
* Real estate valuation, risk assessment, and trends analysis models
* Empirical economic analysis to assess market demand for real property&#x20;
* Quantitative analysis to drive optimum capital- and location allocation

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:&#x20;

* Use a data programming language, such as R or Python,&#x20;
* Import, export, and manipulate data and create statistical summaries,&#x20;
* Produce, interpret, and communicate basic and advanced statistical results,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run intermediate regression models,
* Apply non-linear statistical methods to address questions ill-suited for OLS regression,
* Draw inferences using statistical theory and report in markdowns/notebooks,&#x20;

### Instructor <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

**Instructor's teaching philosophy:** This course's teaching philosophy is composed of the following four components: 1) Develop disciplinary competence through inquiry-based learning, experiential learning (e.g., PBL), research-based learning, and guided discovery learning; 2) Develop interdisciplinary competence emphasizing collaborations and partnerships between programs by working with and learning from learners from other disciplines; 3) Develop intrapersonal competence emphasizing self-directed life-long learning, innovation, critical thinking, ethics, and conscientiousness; 4) Develop interpersonal competence emphasizing communication, teamwork, leadership, project management, and social and intercultural activities.

**Instructor's background:** Armin Yeganeh, Ph.D. is a tenure system Assistant Professor in the Construction Management Program at the School of Planning, Design, and Construction at Michigan State University (MSU). His research questions innovative practices and policies that can help advance construction management, sustainable housing, and real estate development. Armin is interested in employing empirical, quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of economic development, environmental protection, and societal equity to implement sustainability as part of building planning, design, construction, and operations. Before joining MSU, Armin was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Virginia Tech where he earned his Ph.D. in Environmental Design and Planning. During his graduate education, he worked at the Virginia Center for Housing Research on drafting and presenting industry reports, studies, policies, programs, panel discussions, and presentations on housing and community development. Armin received his first master’s degree in Architectural Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. At Virginia Tech, he received a master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning and a master’s degree in Building Science and Construction Management.

**Instructor contact preferences:** The best way to contact the instructor is to reach out by email (armin@msu.edu). Student-instructor communications respect [MSU’s policies on FERPA compliance](https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/privacyguidelines.aspx) and the maintenance of student data confidentiality. Office hours are by appointment. Students are encouraged to make use of office hours to discuss assignments and concepts. Use of office hours counts toward participation grades.

### Course Structure

This course is composed of five modules, and each module is covered in three weeks. Each week involves two lecture sections followed by one lab section structured around case studies. Except for the first week, each week has core and complementary readings. The primary statistical computing package that is used in this course is R, although the choice of software (R vs. Python) is open to learners. R is a data programming language used for statistics, data analysis, text analysis, and machine learning. R arguably is the fastest-growing and leading statistical tool for researchers. It is freely distributed online and can be downloaded from the R homepage [http://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). Students will use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), along with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) Desktop, to complete the assignments.

## Part 3: Assessment <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

Learners will be assessed on participation, weekly quizzes, assignments, and a class presentation. Learners are expected to complete core readings for every module and complementary readings for at least one module based on interest. Learners will report which module for which they would like to complete the complementary readings by way of a poll. Class presentations will revolve around complementary readings and will be led by those who completed the associated readings. At the end of every week's second lecture, there will be short quiz on the assigned core reading.&#x20;

Weekly assignment submissions take the form of a single [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), composed of three sets of lab questions and three sets of homework questions. Except where otherwise noted, assignments are due at the end of the corresponding module, on Fridays at 11:59 pm ET. Assignments will be evaluated on the basis of correctness and style. Complete descriptions and instructions for completing assessments will be provided when assignments are published on the course website. All submissions are individual except where group work is expressly permitted. Adherence to the Honor Code (see below) will be rigorously enforced.

### Grading System

Final grades for this course are reported based on a numerical system that consists of the following scale: 4.0 - 3.5 - 3.0 - 2.5 - 2.0 - 1.5 - 1.0 - 0.0. While the final grades are in increments of 0.5, the Instructor may choose to give an intermediate grade on an assignment, e.g., a 3.3 on the midterm, but round up or down to the nearest reportable grade for the final course grade. All grades are final and may not be changed by re-examination or by the submission of additional work. In this class, the maximum grade is 4.0, which equals 400 points. The final grade equals the sum of points obtained for attendance (45 points), quiz (45 points), lab (90 points), and assignment (220 points). The course includes 45 sessions (each having 1 attendance point), 15 quizzes (each having 3 quiz points), 15 labs (each having 6 lab points), and 5 assignments (each having 40 assignment points). Presentations will have 15 bonus points.  &#x20;

This is a three-credit class that can be taken for an ordinal grade or pass/fail depending on the individual program requirements. The instructor does not have control over the grading option by which learners are evaluated. To change the grading option, learners should contact the registrar’s office and/or the program coordinator. The minimum cumulative grade-point average required for graduation is 3.0 at the graduate school.

## Part 4: Policies <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Academic Support Services&#x20;

Any student requiring academic support should investigate the [Academic Support and Student Services](https://inclusion.msu.edu/campus-resources/academic-support-student-services.html). For complete information on student services, please visit the website for the [Student Affairs and Services](https://provost.msu.edu/about-the-office/academic-and-administrative-units/student-affairs-and-services).&#x20;

### Classroom Accessibility&#x20;

If a student needs adaptations or accommodations because of a disability (learning disability, attention deficit disorder, psychological, physical, etc.), or if there is emergency medical information to share, students can contact the instructor via email or make an appointment to discuss. Any student with a disability that may need accommodations in order to successfully complete all requirements of this course should visit the [Resource Center for Persons with Disabilities](https://www.rcpd.msu.edu), located in Bessey Hall, 434 Farm Lane, #120, East Lansing, MI 48824-1033, or by email at rcpd@msu.edu. This office is responsible for registering students and ensuring the University’s compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Any student requiring such accommodation should discuss this with the course leader and assure that the appropriate official accommodation letter is sent from RCPD. More information about accommodation services available can be found at: [www.rcpd.msu.edu](https://www.rcpd.msu.edu/get-started).&#x20;

### Communication&#x20;

Assignments and class information will be posted on the class website. Questions and discussions will be posted on the discussion board. The instructor will monitor the board and reply within two days in the absence of crowdsourced insight. This is usually better than emailing because discussion and answers may benefit everyone. For other matters, please email the instructor, including the course title in the subject line.&#x20;

### Course Changes

The instructor reserves the right to make changes to the syllabus or course content at any time. Students have the responsibility to check email or in-class announcements for changes in assignment requirements, due dates, and materials.

### Honor Code

The tenets of the Spartan Code of Honor will be strictly enforced in this course, and all assignments shall be subject to the stipulations of the Spartan Code of Honor. It is expected that all students are familiar with the Honor Code. The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) introduced the Spartan Code of Honor academic pledge, focused on valuing academic integrity and honest work ethics at Michigan State University. The pledge reads as follows:

_"As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do."_

Visit the [Spartan Code of Honor](http://asmsu.msu.edu/initiatives/spartan-code-of-honor/) and Office of the University Ombudsperson's [Resources on Academic Integrity](https://ombud.msu.edu/resources-self-help/academic-integrity) to take the pledge and learn how to publicly display your commitment to academic honesty with fellow Spartans. Plagiarism, falsification, tampering, cheating, and unauthorized collaboration are examples of [Academic Misconduct](https://ombud.msu.edu/resources-self-help/academic-integrity).

### **Late Assignments**

Submission of assignments past the posted due date is subject to penalty at the instructor's discretion. If there are circumstances that require late submission of an assignment, learners should contact the instructor as far in advance as possible to discuss a contingency plan. Depending on the circumstances, accommodations may include penalty-free late submission or waiver of the assignment. Learners should be prepared to submit evidence of the circumstances that necessitate accommodation.

### **Participation Expectations**

Active participation in class, e.g., by asking and responding to questions, posting relevant material to the discussion board, and attending office hours results in full participation points. No one type of engagement is required per se, but students will be holistically evaluated on their engagement with the class. In lectures and labs, cell phones must be silenced. Laptop computers must be turned off during lectures, as they are distracting to other students or the instructor.&#x20;

### Time Commitment ****&#x20;

This is a 3-credit hour course, which means learners should anticipate spending at least 2 hours 30 min a week on class materials, which may include attending lectures or participating in lab activities. Additionally, learners should anticipate another two hours of reading/homework/study time per lecture hour, which in total is six hours a week of reading, working on assigned homework, and studying for exams.

We all have a responsibility to foster and maintain respectful relationships with others and to promote an equitable and supportive workplace environment. Civility does not imply homogeneity or the absence of conflict; intellectual exchange (even heated intellectual exchange) is pivotal to our academic mission. That said, we need to engage in reasoned exchanges that are professional, respectful, and considerate of individuals and their differences. Civility is a hallmark of a healthy intellectual community; bullying has no place in one.

### SPDC Community Code of Conduct

The College’s strategic plan identifies six values that guide both how we carry out our day-to-day activities and our interactions with each other, within and outside the College:

#### **Quality:**

* We value multiple perspectives and solicit diverse viewpoints because a healthy exchange of ideas is a pivotal part of the academic enterprise and increases the quality of our work. We are free to disagree with one another and engage in honest debate, but we do so in a manner that embodies comity.
* We lead and interact with positivity and sensitivity to power differentials; we use authority responsibly.

#### Inclusiveness:

* We acknowledge power imbalances and take special care to ensure that the viewpoints of all stakeholders are considered.
* We treat each other with respect.
* We solicit and are receptive to diverse feedback from each other.

#### Connectivity:

* We recognize that our words and actions have consequences for others. We act to advance, not degrade, each others’ productivity, and dignity.
* We cultivate honesty, transparency, and open lines of communication.
* We work to constructively resolve conflict whenever possible, avoiding personal attacks.
* We extend civility to each other through all forms of communication, including email and social media.

#### Integrity:

* We do not spread untruths or engage in ad hominem attacks.
* We give credit to those who deserve it.

#### **Creativity:**

* We ask creative and sometimes difficult questions to ensure we promote and defend academic freedom.
* We innovate to address challenges and overcome barriers.

#### Empowerment:

* We trust each other to lead and complete tasks.
* We are accountable to ourselves and to each other to maintain the values of the College.
