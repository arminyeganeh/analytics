# Syllabus

## Part 1: Introduction <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

### Course Description <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

The term [_Analysis_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analysis) refers to a detailed examination of anything complex in order to understand its nature or to determine its essential features. [_Analytics_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analytics) is the method of logical analysis, often using a model and performed by a computer. _Data Analytics_ is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions. Data analytics help businesses and individuals optimize their performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions. This graduate-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer questions, characterize trends, and identify opportunities for growth. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in business, finance, policy, and their personal life. Using widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will practice various approaches to data analytics, including looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics). Learners will acquire these skills through solving problems focused on housing and community development.

### Course Objectives

This course will cover the following objectives:&#x20;

* Fundamentals of the R programming language for statistical analysis
* Basic principles of sample design and inference
* Assumptions and limitations of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models
* Alternative approaches to analyzing data that violate OLS assumptions&#x20;
* Data reduction and pattern recognition techniques to reduce the dimensionality of data
* ...

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:&#x20;

* Use R, read R documentation, and write R scripts,&#x20;
* Import, export, and manipulate data, and create statistical summaries,&#x20;
* Produce basic and advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run intermediate regression models,
* Apply non-linear statistical methods to address questions ill-suited for OLS regression,
* Draw inferences using statistical theory and report in R Markdown/R Notebooks,&#x20;

### Instructor <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

**Instructor's background:** Armin Yeganeh, Ph.D. is a tenure system Assistant Professor in the Construction Management Program at the School of Planning, Design, and Construction at Michigan State University (MSU). His research questions innovative practices and policies that can help advance construction management, sustainable housing, and real estate development. Armin is interested in employing empirical, quantitative research methods to explore the intersection of economic development, environmental protection, and societal equity to implement sustainability as part of planning, design, construction, and operations. Before joining MSU, Armin was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Virginia Tech where he earned his Ph.D. in Environmental Design and Planning. During his graduate education, he worked at the Virginia Center for Housing Research on drafting and presenting industry reports, studies, policies, programs, panel discussions, and presentations on housing and community development. Armin received his first master’s degree in Architectural Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. At Virginia Tech, he received a master’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning and a master’s degree in Building Science and Construction Management.

**Instructor's teaching philosophy:** The instructor's teaching philosophy is based on the following four pillars: 1) Develop disciplinary competence through inquiry-based learning, experiential learning (e.g., PBL), research-based learning, and guided discovery learning; 2) Develop interdisciplinary competence emphasizing collaborations and partnerships between programs by working with and learning from learners from other disciplines; 3) Develop intrapersonal competence emphasizing self-directed life-long learning, innovation, critical thinking, ethics, and conscientiousness; 4) Develop interpersonal competence emphasizing communication, teamwork, leadership, project management, and social and intercultural activities.

**Instructor contact preferences:** The best way to contact the instructor is to reach out by email (armin@msu.edu). Student-instructor communications respect [MSU’s policies on FERPA compliance](https://reg.msu.edu/roinfo/notices/privacyguidelines.aspx) and the maintenance of student data confidentiality. Office hours are by appointment. Students are encouraged to make use of office hours to discuss assignments and concepts. Use of office hours counts toward participation grades.

### Course Requirements <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

**Course prerequisites:** The only prerequisite for this class is graduate standing at MSU. The class is quantitatively inclined, but university-level math is not required. Students may want to review the following topics if they have not used them recently: [College Algebra](https://openstax.org/details/books/college-algebra), [Calculus](https://openstax.org/details/books/calculus-volume-1), and [Introductory Statistics](https://openstax.org/details/books/introductory-statistics).

### Course Structure

This course is composed of five modules, and each module is covered in three weeks. Each week involves two lecture sections followed by one lab section structured around case studies. Except for the first one, each week has core and complementary readings. The statistical computing package we will use in this course is R, a data programming language used for statistics, data analysis, text analysis, and machine learning. R arguably is the fastest-growing and leading statistical tool for researchers. R is freely distributed online and can be downloaded from the R homepage [http://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/). Students will use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), along with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) Desktop, to complete the assignments.

## Part 3: Assessment <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

Students are expected to complete core readings for every module and complementary readings for at least one module based on student interest. Students will report which module for which they would like to complete the complementary readings by way of a poll. Class discussions will revolve around complementary readings and will be led by students who completed the associated readings. Every week and at the end of the second lecture, there is a short quiz on the assigned core reading. Weekly assignments take the form of a single [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), composed of three sets of lab questions and three sets of homework questions. Except where otherwise noted, assignments are typically due at the end of the corresponding module, on Fridays at 11:59 pm ET. Assignments will be evaluated on the basis of both correctness and style.&#x20;

### Grading System

Final grades for this course are reported based on a numerical system that consists of the following scale: 4.0 - 3.5 - 3.0 - 2.5 - 2.0 - 1.5 - 1.0 - 0.0. While the final grades are in increments of 0.5, the Instructor may choose to give an intermediate grade on an assignment, e.g., a 3.3 on the midterm, but round up or down to the nearest reportable grade for the final course grade. All grades are final and may not be changed by re-examination or by the submission of additional work. In this class, the maximum grade is 4.0, which equals 400 points. The final grade equals the sum of points obtained for attendance (45 points), quiz (45 points), lab (90 points), and assignment (220 points). The course includes 45 sessions (each having 1 attendance point), 15 quizzes (each having 3 quiz points), 15 labs (each having 6 lab points), and 5 assignments (each having 40 assignment points).  &#x20;
