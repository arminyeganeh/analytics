### Course Description <a href="#instructor" id="instructor"></a>

This graduate-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer real-life questions. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in business, finance, and policy areas. Using the most widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will study data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, causal analysis, and machine learning. Through several case studies, learners will apply the acquired skills to problems focused on housing and community development.

### Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:&#x20;

* Use RStudio, read R documentation, and write R scripts,&#x20;
* Import, export, and manipulate data,
* Create statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data,&#x20;
* Produce basic and advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run simple regression models,
* Produce statistical analysis reports in R Markdown/R Notebooks.

### Textbooks

* [Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Analysis-Business-Economics-Policy/dp/1108483011) by G. Bekez and G. Kezdi
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by G. Grolemund and H. Wickham

### Course Work

The statistical computing package we will use in this course is R, which is available on many campus computers. A copy from [http://www.r-project.org](http://www.r-project.org/). We require that you use R Markdown to complete your assignments, which is enabled very nicely with [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

## Part 3: Assessment <a href="#part-1-course-information" id="part-1-course-information"></a>

The final grade is determined by the sum of attendance (10%), bi-weekly assignments (70%), and final project (20%) grades.

Weekly assignments will take the form of a single [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Except where otherwise noted, assignments are typically due in two weeks, on Fridays at 11:59 pm ET. The final course assignment grade will be the average of all assignments, excluding the one that has the lowest grade. Assignments and the final project will be evaluated on the basis of Correctness, Style,&#x20;
