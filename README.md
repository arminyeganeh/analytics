This gradute-level course provides future data analysts with several tools, methods, and skills to answer real-life questions. Learners will practice collecting, preparing, processing, visualizing, and interpreting data, and reporting reproducible results to improve decision-making in business, finance, and policy areas. Using the most widely used statistical programming languages, such as R and Python, learners will study data wrangling and exploration, regression analysis, causal analysis, and machine learning. Through several case studies, learners will apply the acquired skills to problems focused on housing and community development.

* Import, export, and manipulate data,
* Create statistical summaries of continuous and categorical data,&#x20;
* Produce basic and advanced graphics using the ggplot2 library,
* Perform standard hypothesis tests and run simple regression models,
